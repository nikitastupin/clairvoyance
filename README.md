# clairvoyance

Some GraphQL APIs have disabled introspection. For example, [Apollo Server disables introspection automatically if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `production`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/schema/#explore-your-schema).

Clairvoyance allows us to get GraphQL API schema when introspection is disabled. It produces schema in JSON format suitable for other tools like [GraphQL Voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager), [InQL](https://github.com/doyensec/inql) or [graphql-path-enum](https://gitlab.com/dee-see/graphql-path-enum).

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nikitastupin/clairvoyance.git
$ cd clairvoyance
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### From Python interpreter
```
$ python3 -m clairvoyance --help
```

```
$ python3 -m clairvoyance -vv -o /path/to/schema.json -w /path/to/wordlist.txt https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index
```
### From Docker Image
```
$ docker run --rm nikitastupin/clairvoyance --help
```
```
# Assuming the wordlist.txt file is found in $PWD
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/tmp/ nikitastupin/clairvoyance -vv -o /tmp/schema.json -w /tmp/wordlist.txt https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index
```

You can refer to 2nd half of [GraphQL APIs from bug hunter's perspective by Nikita Stupin](https://youtu.be/nPB8o0cSnvM) talk for detailed description.

### Which wordlist should I use?

There are at least two approaches:

- Use general English words (e.g. [google-10000-english](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english)).
- Create target specific wordlist by extracting all valid GraphQL names from application HTTP traffic, from mobile application static files, etc. Regex for GraphQL name is [`[_A-Za-z][_0-9A-Za-z]*`](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Names).

### Environment Variables

```markdown
LOG_FMT=`%(asctime)s \t%(levelname)s\t| %(message)s` # A string format for logging.
LOG_DATEFMT=`%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` # A string format for logging date.
LOG_LEVEL=`INFO` # A string level for logging.
```
