## Introduction

Some GraphQL APIs have disabled introspection. For example, [Apollo Server disables introspection automatically if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `production`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/schema/#explore-your-schema).

Clairvoyance helps to obtain GraphQL API schema even if the introspection is disabled. It produces schema in JSON format suitable for other tools like [GraphQL Voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager), [InQL](https://github.com/doyensec/inql) or [graphql-path-enum](https://gitlab.com/dee-see/graphql-path-enum).

## Getting Started

### pip

```bash
pip install clairvoyance
clairvoyance https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql -o schema.json
# should take about 2 minutes
```

### docker

```bash
docker run --rm nikitastupin/clairvoyance --help
```

## Advanced Usage

### Which wordlist should I use?

There are at least two approaches:

- Use general English words (e.g. [google-10000-english](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english)).
- Create target specific wordlist by extracting all valid GraphQL names from application HTTP traffic, from mobile application static files, etc. Regex for GraphQL name is [`[_A-Za-z][_0-9A-Za-z]*`](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Names).

### Environment variables

```bash
LOG_FMT=`%(asctime)s \t%(levelname)s\t| %(message)s` # A string format for logging.
LOG_DATEFMT=`%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` # A string format for logging date.
LOG_LEVEL=`INFO` # A string level for logging.
```
